# CS-330 Computer Graphics Final Project

# How do I approach designing software?
I start by figuring out what the software needs to do and who will use it. Then I make a plan, often using simple drawings or charts to organize how everything will work before writing any code.

# What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I learned how to plan out 3D scenes better, use lighting and space, and make things look more real while keeping the design organized and easy to manage.

# What design process did you follow for your project work?
I planned out my ideas, made a basic version of the project, tested it, and kept improving it step by step until it looked and worked the way I wanted.

# How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I can use the same method of building small parts, testing them, and improving them in future projects to make sure I create something useful and well-designed.

# How do I approach developing programs?
I break the problem into smaller pieces and build them one at a time. I test each part to make sure it works before putting everything together.

# What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I used techniques like reusing shapes, organizing objects in groups, and setting up lighting to make the scene look real without writing too much extra code.

# How did iteration factor into your development?
I kept testing and making small changes to fix problems and improve the scene. Each version was better than the last.

# How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
At first, I just tried to make it work. Later, I focused on making my code cleaner, easier to read, and better organized.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
It teaches me how to solve problems, build useful tools, and understand how technology works—skills that can help in many careers, especially in tech and security.

# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
They helped me learn how to use math and visuals to show complex ideas clearly, which can be useful in future classes that involve graphics or data.

# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
They taught me how to turn ideas into visuals and interactive scenes, which can help in jobs that involve design, presentations, user interfaces, or security dashboards.
